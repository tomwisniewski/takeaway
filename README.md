This repo contains my response to a coding challenge set in 2013 by Evgeny Shadchnev at Makers Academy.

Task 2 Details
Feel free to use google, your notes, books, etc but work on your own.

Write a class Takeaway.
Implement the following functionality:
list of dishes with prices
place the order by giving the list of dishes, their quantities and a number that should be an exact total. If the sum is not correct the method should raise an error, otherwise the customer is sent a text saying that the order was placed successfully and that it will be delivered 1 hour from now (e.g. "Thank you! Your order was placed and will be delivered before 18:52".)
The test sending functionality should be implemented using Twilio API. You'll need to register for it.
Use twilio-ruby gem to access the API
Use a Gemfile to manage your gems
Make sure that your Takeaway class is thoroughly thested and that you use mocks and/or stubs, as necessary to not send texts when your tests are run.
If your Takeaway class were to be loaded into IRB and the order was placed, the test should actually be sent
A free account on Twilio will only allow you to send tests to "verified" numbers. Use your own mobile phone number, don't worry about the customer's mobile phone.
